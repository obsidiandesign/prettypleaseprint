# The API

[← back to the README](../README.md)

Everything the app does over HTTP, and how to drive it yourself.

There is a console at **`/docs`** — Swagger UI, served from this origin, with
your session already attached. It is linked from the account menu. This page is
the reading version: what the endpoints are for, and the handful of decisions
that will otherwise surprise you.

## The short version

```bash
# 1. Sign in. The token comes back in a response header.
TOKEN=$(curl -si https://print.example/api/auth/sign-in/username \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"ayla","password":"…"}' \
  | grep -i '^set-auth-token:' | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr -d '\r')

# 2. Use it.
curl -s https://print.example/api/stories \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | jq '.stories[] | {ref, title, status}'
```

## Authentication

There is **no public sign-up and no separate API key**. An account exists only
where an invitation was accepted, and the API uses the same session as the
browser. Two ways to carry it:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Session cookie** | What a browser already holds. `Try it out` at `/docs` works with no setup at all. |
| **Bearer token** | Any sign-in response carries `set-auth-token`. Send it back as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. |

The bearer token **is** the session token. That has consequences worth knowing
before you paste one into a script:

- Signing out revokes it, at the same instant it revokes the cookie. So does an
  admin revoking access, and so does a password reset.
- It carries exactly the authority of the account it came from — no more, and
  no less. There is no scope, no read-only variant and no long-lived key.
- It lasts as long as a session does: **twenty minutes of inactivity**. A
  script that runs longer than that between calls has to sign in again — which
  is the intended answer for anything unattended.
- Unlike the cookie it is not `HttpOnly` and not `SameSite`-protected. It lands
  in shell history, in CI logs and in `ps` output. For anything that runs
  unattended, sign in fresh rather than reusing the token from the browser you
  are sitting in, and sign out when the job is done.

Nothing else is a way in. There is no `?token=` parameter, no basic auth, and
no header that names a user.

## What you can reach

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Can the app serve? The only endpoint with no session. |
| `GET` | `/api/stories` | Your tickets. The printer owner's is everyone's. |
| `POST` | `/api/stories` | Open a request from a MakerWorld link. JSON. |
| `GET` | `/api/stories/{id}` | One ticket. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/stories/{id}` | Withdraw your own request. |
| `POST` | `/api/stories/{id}/decline` | Say no. *Printer owner.* |
| `POST` | `/api/stories/{id}/flag` | Flag a model problem, with a reason. *Printer owner.* |
| `DELETE` | `/api/stories/{id}/flag` | Clear the flag. *Printer owner.* |
| `GET` `POST` | `/api/stories/{id}/comments` | The conversation on a ticket. |
| `GET` | `/api/notifications` | Your Activity feed. |
| `POST` | `/api/notifications/read` | Mark one read, or all of them. |
| `GET` | `/api/openapi.json` | This surface, machine-readable. |
| | `/api/auth/*` | Every Better Auth endpoint — sign-in, passkeys, admin, reset. |

`{id}` is the numeric id — `4`, not `PPP-104`. The display ref comes back on
every ticket as `ref`.

## Five things that will otherwise surprise you

**1. Nothing moves a status by hand.** The flow is
`Requested → Slicing → Ready → Printing → Done`, with `Failed` and `Declined`
off to the side, and every step but `Declined` is read from Bambuddy — the
pipeline run while it slices, then the queue entry it lands in. There is no
endpoint that advances a ticket or sets its status, because the board's whole
claim is that it shows where the work actually is, and only the print farm
knows that. `Declined` is the printer owner's one lever, and only from
`Requested`: once a request has reached Bambuddy, saying no is a conversation
rather than a state change.

**2. `404` and `403` mean different things, deliberately.** A ticket you may
not see is `404`, because a `403` would confirm it exists — the same rule the
pages follow. An *action* you may not take is `403`, because these endpoints
are listed in `/api/openapi.json` and pretending they are missing would help
nobody and confuse an honest client whose ticket is fine.

**3. Withdrawing is the requester's, and it is not the printer owner's.**
Seeing every story is the widest scope in the app and it still does not include
deleting somebody's request. And it only works before Bambuddy holds anything for it —
`Requested` or `Declined`. Past that you get `409` and the name of the person
to ask. Decline and withdraw also answer `409` while the request is being
handed to Bambuddy, which takes up to about a minute. Don't just retry: re-read
the ticket. Usually it has landed in `Slicing`, and then neither applies any
more. Only if intake failed and left it `Requested` can you try again. (If the
process running intake died mid-handoff, its claim lapses after ten minutes.)

**4. Writes refuse a foreign `Origin`.** CSRF here rests on `SameSite=Lax` plus
an Origin check, which is Better Auth's model and the app keeps to it. A
request with *no* `Origin` header is fine — that is `curl`, and it is not a
browser being driven by somebody else's page. A request with the wrong one is
`403`.

**5. A request is a link, not a file, and the colour is a spool.** `modelUrl`
must be a MakerWorld model page (`https://makerworld.com/.../models/<id>`);
anything else could never be fetched, so it is refused up front. `spoolId` is
the only thing that names a colour: it is looked up in Bambuddy's live
inventory at that moment, must still be on the shelf (`409` if it has gone)
and must be PLA, because the one slicer pipeline is a PLA recipe (`400`
otherwise). Material, colour name and hex are copied from the spool, never
taken from the body. The requester comes from the session: an `uploaderId` or
a `status` in the body is ignored.

The ticket is created, then handed to Bambuddy in the same request, so the
response usually already reads `Slicing`. If Bambuddy stumbles after the ticket
exists, you still get `201` with the ticket `Requested` and an `errorMessage`,
and the next sync retries it. If Bambuddy cannot be reached *before* the ticket
exists — the spool lookup — you get `503` and nothing is created.

```bash
curl -s https://print.example/api/stories \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Cable clip","modelUrl":"https://makerworld.com/en/models/123456",
       "spoolId":7,"quantity":2,"note":"No rush"}'
```

`tip` is optional and only counts while the printer owner has the tip jar
switched on: then it must be the label of an active benefit, or you get `400`.
While the jar is off it is ignored, and every ticket's `tip` comes back as
`""`.

There is no endpoint that lists spools yet, so a script has to know the
Bambuddy spool id it wants; the upload form is where the live list is shown.

A ticket on the wire stops at `status` and `errorMessage`: the Bambuddy library
file, pipeline run and queue entry behind it are sync plumbing and never leave
the server.

## Errors

One shape, everywhere, and the message is written for a person:

```json
{ "error": "PPP-104 is already printing — ask Ruben instead." }
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | The request did not parse, or a field failed validation. |
| `401` | No session, or the account has been suspended. |
| `403` | Authenticated, but not allowed — or a foreign `Origin` on a write. |
| `404` | No such thing, **or** not one you may see. |
| `409` | Real, yours, and not in a state where that makes sense. |
| `503` | Bambuddy could not be reached to check the spool. Nothing was created; try again. |
| `500` | Our fault. The message never carries detail — no stack, no query. |

`500` bodies are deliberately uninformative. The detail is in the server log,
where it belongs.

## Paging

`GET /api/stories` returns at most 25 by default (100 maximum) and a
`nextCursor`. Feed it back as `?before=`:

```bash
curl -s "https://print.example/api/stories?status=Printing&limit=50" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

A cursor rather than an offset, because a ticket created mid-page makes
`skip`/`take` repeat a row or drop one. `status` may be repeated
(`?status=Requested&status=Printing`) or comma-separated.

## Where the rules actually live

Both front doors — the server-rendered forms and these endpoints — call
[`src/lib/stories.ts`](../src/lib/stories.ts). Who may move a ticket, from
which state, who gets told and what goes in the audit trail is decided there
and nowhere else, so the API cannot quietly enforce less than the UI does.
`npm run verify:api` drives the JSON surface against every rule
`npm run verify:queue` drives through the forms.

The boundary itself — 401 vs 403, the Origin check, and the list of fields that
may go on the wire — is [`src/lib/api.ts`](../src/lib/api.ts). Nothing spreads
a database row into a response: every field is named, which is why adding a
column tomorrow cannot leak it.

## The document, and the console

`/api/openapi.json` is OpenAPI 3.1, assembled per request from two halves: the
app's own paths, and Better Auth's, generated by the library so they cannot
drift when a plugin is added. Request bodies are converted from the same Zod
schemas the handlers validate with, so the document cannot promise a rule the
server does not enforce.

Both it and `/docs` need a session. They describe an invite-only tool to the
people already inside it, and an unauthenticated endpoint is not the place to
publish a map of your authority model.

Swagger UI is **vendored, not loaded from a CDN** —
`npm run vendor:swagger` copies it out of `node_modules` into `public/docs/`,
which `predev` and `prebuild` run for you. Three reasons: the app's
`script-src 'self'` would refuse a CDN, a deployment on an isolated VLAN has no
outbound internet, and a CDN is a third party in the request path of a tool
that is otherwise entirely first-party.

Generating a client is the usual thing:

```bash
curl -s https://print.example/api/openapi.json -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" > openapi.json
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.json -g typescript-fetch -o ./client
```

## What is not here

- **No webhooks.** Nothing calls out. If you want to know when a ticket moves,
  poll `/api/notifications`.
- **No bulk endpoints.** Five people and one printer; a loop is fine.
- **No API keys, scopes or service accounts.** Every call is made *as* a
  person, and the audit trail names them. That is the property worth keeping.
- **No CORS headers.** The API is same-origin, and a bearer token from another
  origin cannot get past the preflight. Fetching it from a page you host
  elsewhere is not a supported thing to do.
