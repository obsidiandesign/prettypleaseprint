# Architecture and design decisions

[← back to the README](../README.md)

How the pieces work, and the places where this app deliberately departs from
the design handoff it was built from.

## The viewer

Story detail renders the actual uploaded geometry with three.js — `STLLoader`
for `.stl`, `ThreeMFLoader` for `.3mf` — auto-framed, drag to rotate, with an
idle spin that stops on first touch and never starts under
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

The handoff's lighting rig is kept exactly: hemisphere, a key at (3,5,4) and a
cool rim behind. It reads well on filament colours from near-black to bone
white, which is the whole job. The ground and grid moved to this palette,
because the print bed should look like the app it sits in.

It declines anything over **50 MB** (`VIEWER_MAX_BYTES`) and says so, with the
model's size drawn against that limit so "180 MB" means something. That is not
a limit on what may be uploaded — the cap is 250 MB — it is a limit on what a
laptop can be asked to rebuild: the viewer downloads the whole file and expands
every triangle into typed arrays, and past that size the tab stops answering
for long enough that people assume the app has broken.

The decision is made from the stored `fileSize`, **before anything is fetched**.
That ordering is the point: a check after the download would still have pulled
a quarter of a gigabyte across the office and only then given up. The refusal
is amber rather than red because nothing has failed — the file is whole, it
prints, and Download and Open in PrusaSlicer are both built for meshes this
size where a browser is not.

Three details worth knowing:

- **The bytes are proxied, not signed.** `/api/models/[id]` streams from
  object storage through the app. That is not the elegant option, it is the
  only correct one here: the deployment publishes no port for MinIO, so a
  signed URL would point at something the browser cannot reach. Proxying also
  keeps `connect-src` at `'self'`, so the viewer needs no CSP relaxation —
  verified with zero violations in a real browser.
- **It is scoped like the story.** Same `storyScope` fragment, so a client
  asking for someone else's model gets 404, not 403.
- **three.js is imported dynamically**, inside the effect. It is fetched when
  someone opens a ticket and never on the board or the queue.

The trade: every viewer load moves the whole file through Next. At 250 MB and a
handful of people that is fine. If this ever faces a wider audience, put
storage behind the same reverse proxy, hand out a signed URL, and widen
`connect-src` to that origin.

## Uploads

`POST /api/upload` is a route handler rather than a server action, so the
browser can watch a real XHR progress bar — a large model over office wifi is
too long for a spinner.

Nothing is written to storage until the bytes have been inspected, and no
story row exists until the object is in place: a rejected file leaves nothing
behind, and a story never points at an object that was not stored.

`src/lib/models.ts` decides what is acceptable, against the bytes rather than
the filename:

- **Binary STL is identified structurally** — 80-byte header, uint32 triangle
  count, exactly 50 bytes per triangle. If `84 + count × 50` does not equal
  the file length it is not a binary STL. This check runs *first*, because
  some tools write the word `solid` into a binary STL's header and a naive
  sniffer reads that as the ASCII format.
- **3MF must be a zip containing a model part**, and the archive is guarded
  against inflating to an implausible size.
- **Extension and content must agree.** An STL renamed `.3mf` is refused even
  though both are printable.
- **Storage keys are generated, never derived from the filename** — that is
  how path traversal and object overwrites happen. The display name lives in
  a database column.

Bounding boxes are measured from the actual mesh, honouring the 3MF `unit`
attribute. Nothing is inferred beyond that — see the estimate decision above.

`npm run verify:models` covers all of this with 29 checks, including a PDF and
an ELF binary renamed `.stl`, an STL that lies about its triangle count, a
traversal path inside a 3MF, and a zip bomb.

### How big a model may be, and the limit that was not real

The cap is **250 MB**, raised from the handoff's 50 MB because real work went
past it — multi-object plates and scanned meshes — and the app's answer was
"decimate the mesh", which is asking somebody to damage their model to fit an
arbitrary number.

Raising it turned up something worse: **the 50 MB was never real either.** Next
truncates a request body at 10 MB whenever middleware is in play, and this app
runs middleware on every route to mint the CSP nonce. Anything past 10 MB
arrived short, `request.formData()` threw on the truncated body, and the
uploader was told *"That upload did not arrive intact"* — which reads like a
network fault and sends people to look in the wrong place. It survived the
whole life of the app because every fixture in every suite is a few hundred
bytes; nothing had ever uploaded a big file. `verify:upload` now sends a 12 MB
model on every run, which is the cheapest thing that would have caught it.

Three numbers, in `src/lib/upload-limits.ts`, deliberately in one place because
the form, the validator, the OpenAPI document and the framework config all need
to agree:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | 250 MB — the file itself |
| `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` | `× 1.2` — the whole multipart body, and the transport ceiling. It has to be the more generous of the two, or a file just over the cap gets truncated into a parse error instead of an honest "too large" |
| `MAX_INFLATED_BYTES` | `× 3` — what a 3MF may inflate to, scaled off the cap so raising one cannot leave the other behind |

### Why the memory is bounded by a queue rather than a stream

`request.formData()` buffers the entire body before a line of this app's code
runs, so peak memory is decided by how many large uploads overlap — not by
anything the validator does. The security audit named the two answers: a
streaming parse, or a size-based queue. This is the queue: at most two uploads
are handled at once (`MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS`), a third waits rather than being
refused, and only a long queue gets a `503`.

The streaming parse is the better answer and it is not reachable from here. It
needs the file to stop arriving as multipart at all — a raw body with the wish
in a header, or a two-phase upload — because by the time a route handler can
see the request, the framework has already buffered it. That is a protocol
change touching the form, the API, the OpenAPI document and two suites, and it
is worth doing the day the queue is the thing that hurts.

## Decisions taken against the handoff

The handoff contradicts itself in two places and leaves three things open.
All five are settled, and recorded here so nobody has to re-derive them:

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Tip pill radius — README §3 says `8px`, the prototype renders `999px` | **8px.** The tokens reserve `999px` for "avatars, dots and status chips only", so two written sources beat the render. |
| *Printing* column label — README §2 says amber `#79541a`, the prototype uses teal `#0b4340` | **Amber.** The tokens call amber "warning / in-progress only", and Printing is the in-progress state. It also makes the live column findable. |
| Where declined stories go — `Declined` is not in the flow, so it has no column | **Off the board entirely.** The board is for work that is still moving; the profile at `/me` carries the whole history, declined included. |
| The whole-board empty state, which the handoff says to ask about | **Minimal.** One quiet panel saying what is true, with the Upload button already above it. No invented onboarding. |
| Print-time estimates | **Dropped.** See below. |

### The one stat that changed

The handoff's admin profile card is "Printer time given". There is no honest
number behind it once print-time estimates are gone, so rather than invent
one it counts something real — how much geometry has actually come off the
plate, in bytes. Swap it back the day a slicer is wired in and the hours are
known rather than assumed.

### Why there is no print-time estimate

A figure derived from the bounding box is a guess dressed as a measurement —
it cannot know infill, layer height, wall count or the printer's speeds, and
it is worst on exactly the models people care about. The handoff's definition
of done says nothing should claim to know what the printer is doing, and a
number someone might plan their afternoon around is the kind of claim it warns
about.

So the app shows only what it measured: **dimensions and file size**. A story
in *Printing* says `on the bed` and nothing more.

To add a real one, run `prusa-slicer --export-gcode` in a background job after
upload and read `; estimated printing time` out of the G-code. `src/lib/models.ts`
says so at the point where the old heuristic used to live.

## The API, and why there is a service layer

Everything the queue can do is reachable over JSON as well as through the
forms — see [the API](api.md). Adding that changed the shape of the code in
one significant way, and it is the part worth knowing about.

The admin actions used to live entirely in `src/app/actions/stories.ts`: read
the `FormData`, check the role, check the transition, write the row, notify the
uploader, write the audit event, redirect. Copying that into a route handler
would have meant two implementations of four rules, and the second one only has
to forget once. So the operations moved to **`src/lib/stories.ts`**, which
takes an `Actor` and decides for itself who may do what. The server actions
became adapters — `FormData` in, redirect out — and the route handlers are
adapters too: JSON in, status code out.

The practical test of that is `npm run verify:api`, which drives the JSON
surface against every rule `npm run verify:queue` drives through the forms, and
gets the same answers.

Three decisions inside it that look odd on purpose:

- **The API answers 403 where a page answers 404.** Everywhere else, a surface
  you may not reach returns 404 so that a 403 cannot confirm it exists. That
  reasoning does not survive publishing an OpenAPI document:
  `/api/stories/{id}/advance` is listed at `/api/openapi.json`, so hiding it is
  theatre — and it would tell an honest client their ticket had vanished when
  the truth is that they are not the printer owner. Whether a *ticket* exists
  is still hidden, through the same `storyScope` fragment.
- **There is no endpoint that sets a status.** `advance` derives the next state
  rather than accepting one. An endpoint taking a target status is an
  invitation to skip a step, and the board's whole claim is that it shows where
  work actually is.
- **Nothing spreads a database row onto the wire.** `src/lib/api.ts` names
  every field it emits. That is what keeps `storageKey` — the object's name in
  the bucket — out of every response without anyone having to remember to strip
  it, and it is what makes a column added tomorrow private by default.

The document at `/api/openapi.json` is assembled per request from two halves:
the app's own paths, written out, with request bodies converted from the same
Zod schemas the handlers validate with; and Better Auth's, generated by the
library so they cannot drift when a plugin is added or a version bumped.

The console at `/docs` is a plain HTML route rather than a page, because
Swagger UI's stylesheet expects to own the document and the root layout owns
this one — four self-hosted webfonts, a diner palette and a paper texture.
Swagger UI itself is copied out of `node_modules` at build time by
`scripts/vendor-swagger.ts`: a CDN would be refused by `script-src 'self'`,
would be unreachable on a NAS with no outbound internet, and would put a third
party in the request path of an otherwise entirely first-party tool.

## The audit page, and why it grew panels

`/admin/audit` was always defended with the same argument: for one printer and
five colleagues, a screen the owner glances at beats threshold alerts nobody
tunes and everybody learns to ignore. That argument has a hole in it — it only
works if somebody looks, and a reverse-chronological wall of rows is not
something anyone opens twice.

So three panels sit above the log, in `src/lib/dashboard.ts`. They answer the
questions a person arrives with, none of which a log answers by being scrolled:
**is anything being refused**, **where is work piling up**, and **what should I
buy**.

Two rules held while building them, and they are the interesting part:

- **Aggregation only.** No column exists because of this page, and nothing is
  recorded for it. Everything is derived from rows that were already there — the
  stage medians, for instance, are reconstructed from the `from` field every
  `story.status_changed` was already carrying. A dashboard that needs its own
  schema has stopped being a view and started being a feature.
- **Events from the trail, work from the tables.** The refusals panel reads
  `AuditEvent`; the material, colour and size panel reads `Story`. The audit
  trail is a log, not a warehouse, and querying it for things the domain tables
  already know is how a log slowly turns into a schema nobody meant to design.

No charting library. A CDN would be refused by `script-src 'self'`, would be
unreachable on a NAS with no outbound internet, and it is four bars — the same
reasoning that vendored Swagger UI rather than linking it.

## The feature-request track ('frr')

A second backlog lives at `/frr`: anyone files a feature request, and the owner
triages it through the same board, queue, status flow, conversation,
notifications and audit trail as a print — see
[Feature requests](feature-requests.md).

It is built as a deliberate **parallel** of the print backlog, not folded into
it. There is a `FeatureRequest`/`FeatureComment` pair of tables and a
`src/lib/features.ts` service that mirrors `stories.ts` operation-for-operation;
`Story`, the upload, the viewer and the JSON API are untouched, with no `kind`
flag threading feature logic through them. The pure rules sit beside the print
ones in `scope.ts` — `featureScope`, `FEATURE_FLOW`, `assertFeatureTransition`,
`featureRef` — and are kept parallel rather than merged into one generic helper
on purpose: the print rules are load-bearing and exercised directly by the
suites, so a shared cleverness a change to one backlog could bend for the other
is a worse trade than a little duplication. The *shape* is identical, which is
what makes the owner handle a request exactly as they handle a print.

Where the two backlogs meet is shared infrastructure, extended additively: one
`Notification` row can point at a story or a feature (a nullable `featureId`,
and the Activity feed routes to `/story` or `/frr` on whichever is set), and the
audit trail gained `feature.*` verbs. Neither change alters how a print behaves.
`npm run verify:frr` drives the whole track the way `verify:queue` drives the
print one.

## Later additions, kept thin

Several features that came after are deliberately additions on top of the two
backlogs rather than new subsystems, each covered by the verify suite for its
side:

- **Withdraw reaches `Accepted`, and a past print can be re-queued.** The
  withdraw window widened from `Requested`/`Declined` to include `Accepted`
  (before the bed is committed). `requeueStory` clones an old ticket into a
  fresh `Requested` one, copying the file server-side (`copyModel`) to a new
  object so the two own independent bytes.
- **`/history`** is a scoped read of the finished prints (`Delivery`/`Done`/
  `Declined`) through the same `storyScope`, filtered by status/material/date,
  with the re-queue control on each row. `/board` and `/me` are untouched.
- **The benefits (tips) are owner-managed data**, not a constant: a `Benefit`
  table the owner edits at `/admin/benefits`, seeded with the original five.
  `Story.tip` stays a plain string so a past request survives an edit, and the
  upload endpoint validates the tip against the current *active* list — the
  catalogue, not the form, is authoritative.
- **A feature request's priority is editable in any status, and both `/frr`
  views filter** by priority/status/category. The filter is ANDed onto
  `featureScope`, so it can only ever narrow a caller's own set.
- **An optional free-text print-settings field** rides along on a request and
  shows on the ticket for the owner. The structured / access-gated "advanced
  mode" is deferred.

## What is deliberately not built

- **Email/Slack notification delivery.** `Notification` rows and the `notify()`
  helper exist and the Activity panel reads them; only the in-app record is
  written so far.
- **A designed whole-board empty state.** There is a minimal one that says what
  is true rather than showing a blank page, but the handoff asks for a design
  decision here — treat it as a placeholder.
