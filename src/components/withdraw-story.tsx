import { withdrawStory } from "@/app/actions/stories";

/**
 * "Actually, never mind."
 *
 * Shown only to the person who asked for the print, and only before it reaches
 * the bed — `Requested` (untouched), `Accepted` (agreed, not started) or
 * `Declined` (already dead). Once it is Printing the material is committed, so
 * the control is withdrawn (FRR-101). The server action re-checks; drawing a
 * button is not authorisation.
 *
 * Behind a disclosure, because this is the one action in the app that
 * destroys something. Everything else moves a ticket along or marks it;
 * this removes it and the conversation with it.
 *
 * The trigger is a *button*, in the same enamel shape as Decline and Flag in
 * `admin-actions.tsx`. It used to be drawn with a transparent border and muted
 * text, growing an outline only on hover — which meant it read as a caption
 * rather than a control, and read as one directly above "Print again", which
 * is a full button. People could not find it. A destructive action being the
 * quietest thing on the page is the wrong way round: hard to *fire* by
 * accident is the goal, not hard to *locate*.
 *
 * So it carries colour as well as shape — cherry-wash with cherry-dark text
 * (5.1:1), going solid on hover. That keeps the two steps legible as an
 * escalation: an outlined red button opens the drawer, a filled red one
 * commits. Tone is carried by the fill *and* by the word, never by colour
 * alone, which is the rule the notices follow.
