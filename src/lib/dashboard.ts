 * The numbers behind `/admin/audit`.

 * than a warehouse, so the panels that are really about the *work* — what gets
 * asked for, how big it is — read `Story` directly, and only the panels about
 * *events* read `AuditEvent`. Mixing those up is how a log slowly turns into a
 * schema nobody meant to design.
 *
 * Everything is scoped to the printer owner by the page that calls it; these
 * functions are unscoped on purpose, because there is exactly one admin and
 * `/admin/audit` is the only caller.
