/**
 * The audit trail.
 *
 * Every action that changes who can get in, or what happens to someone's
 * model, writes a row here. Rows are never updated or deleted by the app.
 *
 * Two rules for callers:
 *   - Never pass a token, a password, a signed URL or file contents in
 *     `detail`. The trail is meant to be readable by whoever runs the
 *     printer, and a secret in a log is a secret in one more place.
 *   - Record after the change has committed, so the trail cannot claim
 *     something that did not happen.
