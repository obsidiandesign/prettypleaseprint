 * A deliberate mirror of `src/lib/stories.ts`: same shape, same four rules
 * (role checked every time, transitions through `assertFeatureTransition`, the
 * requester always told, an audit row after the change commits), so the owner
 * handles a feature request exactly as they handle a print. Kept parallel
 * rather than generalised because the print service is load-bearing and
 * separately tested — a shared abstraction would couple two backlogs that are
 * better off independent.
 *
 * As in `stories.ts`, nothing here knows about redirects or HTTP status pages.
 * A refusal leaves as a `FeatureProblem` carrying a sentence for a person; the
 * server action turns it into a toast.
