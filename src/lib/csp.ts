/**
 * Content-Security-Policy, built per request around a fresh nonce.
 *
 * The value that matters is `script-src`. Next.js hydrates from an inline
 * bootstrap script, so a nonce-less policy would have to allow
 * 'unsafe-inline' there — which makes the whole header decorative. Instead
 * middleware mints a nonce per request and Next stamps it onto its own
 * scripts, so inline script runs only when it carries that request's nonce.
 *
 * `strict-dynamic` lets those nonced scripts pull in the rest of the Next
 * chunk graph without every chunk needing its own nonce. Browsers that honour
 * it ignore the host allowlist; older ones fall back to 'self'.
 *
 * `style-src` does NOT need 'unsafe-inline'. The webfonts are committed
 * (src/app/fonts.css) and bundled into /_next/static at build time, so the
 * rendered page contains no inline <style> block and no request to
 * fonts.googleapis.com. What the page does contain is a couple of inline
 * `style=` attributes from component code, and those are governed separately
 * by `style-src-attr`. Splitting the two keeps the broad allowance off the
 * directive that can pull in a whole stylesheet.
 *
 * Development relaxes script-src because the dev server needs eval for HMR.
