/**
 * Flag a model problem, and clear it again.
 *
 * A flag does NOT change the status — the ticket is still wherever it was, it
 * just carries a note saying why it cannot proceed as-is. `reason` is required
 * and at least three characters, because "flagged" with no explanation tells
 * the person waiting nothing they can act on.
 *
 * `DELETE` is the way off. A flag with no way off is a dead end: the ticket
 * would carry "needs a look" for the rest of its life even after the model
 * was fixed.
