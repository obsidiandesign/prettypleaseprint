/**
 * One ticket, and taking it back.
 *
 * `GET` is scoped: a client naming somebody else's id is answered 404, not
 * 403, because a 403 would confirm the ticket exists. That is the same
 * decision the story page makes, through the same `storyScope` fragment.
 *
 * `DELETE` is the requester withdrawing their own request, and is refused
 * once the printer owner has started on it. The printer owner cannot delete
 * somebody's ticket through it either — being able to see every story is not
 * being allowed to withdraw one. Both rules are `withdrawStory`'s, so the
 * form and this endpoint cannot disagree.
